# bridge coding
Coding scripts and resources for the Temple summer BRIDGE program

The goal of this workshop is to get familiar with some of the basics of coding in R (and hopefully one day Python). In this repository, there are copies of the scripts that we will be using during the workshop, and the dataset that will serve as the basis for our work. 

dataset: We'll be using a publicly available dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/), the world happiness data from the UN in 2016: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhanupratapbiswas/world-happiness-2016

what you'll need: We will be doing this using Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) which is a free Jupyter Notebook provider that gives free access to computing resources.
